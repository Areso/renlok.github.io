Original idea from [MarcoWorms](https://github.com/MarcoWorms). Just used a fork in order to make something more fresh and updated.

WIP.

Planned (in order of priority, at least ALMOST) :

- Ordering team
- Auto-healer (and having a manual option later)
- Controling the evolution of a Pok√©mon
- More options in catching Pokemon
- Shiny stuff
- Other generations (can be done now, so adding database for the moment ONLY)

My coding skills are really really (when I say really it's really) limited. So any help would be more than apprecied. Just trying to bring some ideas and doing the boring stuff.

Changelog :

NGGYU.7 (14/03/17) :
- Finally a way to order Pokemon team. FOR THE MOMENT there's a button "First!" just click on it and the Pokemon will be on the top of the list. It does the job for the moment perfectly. Huge thanks to piiih for this feature !

NGGYU.6 (12/03/17) :
- Another huge clean in the original code (database related)
- Fixing types chart ! (For example Dragon hitting ONLY * .1 on Rock Pokemon)
- Preparing stuff for event days (Bonus of experience OR catch rate for the moment) stay tunned for that !
- Stats for the mega Pokemon of the 1G added ! You can check how to get them in the future, not available
- Finally a favicon
- All Pokemon are now available (I deleted some of them by mistake by redoing the routes)
- **HUGE GAMEPLAY CHANGE** : Before, the game didn't take in consideration Special Stats. This way, Chansey was really under-powered or Pokemon like Mewtwo would be less effective. Before, Pokemon were using only Attack + Defense. Now it's the average of both Physical and Special stats. This should change a lot of things. Keep me updated for any bug or anything.

NGGYU.5 (03/05/17) : 
- Fixed Eeveelutions by being available in the wild
- Fixed some Fairy glitched Pokemon
- Fixed https links with the help of the PR
- Fixed the level 101 glitch (level 100 is the max level, it'll be adjusted if you had a level 101 Pokemon)
- Better catch rate (need feedback for this)
- Updated the CSS in order to have the same looks as before (bad edit before in order to have all areas in the same place)
- **HUGE** update of the database. Deleted 70k of lines for stuff NOT used in game. Edited in order to add new gens without any difficulty. So this will be a thing soon.

NGGYU.4 (03/02/17) :
- Updated the catch rates. 90% of them were missing. Should change the gameplay A LOT.

NGGYU.3 (03/01/17) :
- Areas redone completly. Removed customs areas for matching the real routes from Kanto. CSS need to be updated.

NGGYU.2 (02/28/17) :
- Fixed all the evolutions levels.

NGGYU.1 (02/28/17) :
- Initial Version
