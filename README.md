Original idea from [MarcoWorms](https://github.com/MarcoWorms). Just used a fork in order to make something more fresh and updated.

Huge thanks to [piiih](https://github.com/piiih) for some awesome features ! Huge thanks to [Fastigium](https://github.com/Fastigium) who helped to make the evolve system a new brand thing !

A subreddit for the game is now open ! You can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pokeidle/) but like the game, still in progress !

WIP.

Planned (in order of priority, at least ALMOST) :

- More options in catching Pokemon
- Shiny stuff
- Other generations (can be done now, so adding database for the moment ONLY)

My coding skills are really really (when I say really it's really) limited. So any help would be more than apprecied. Just trying to bring some ideas and doing the boring stuff.

Changelog :

NGGYU 1.0 (07/15/17) :
- Evolve Button ! Finally ! It was long, I know. It was boring, I know. But PokeIdle is now in 1.0 ! The evolve button is here. In the manage team, once your Pokemon is ready to evolve you can choose to evolve it OR NOT. This means that Mega Pokemon are coming REALLY soon (aka a few hours), and MORE gens soon too. Huge thanks to [Fastigium](https://github.com/Fastigium) for completing the work !

NGGYU.9 (03/20/17) :
- Manage Team updated : Maybe not an important thing, but it needs to be clear. From now, you can order AND release with the 'Manage Team' checked. So no more 'First' button on the page, and changed to up & down buttons !

NGGYU.8 (03/18/17) :
- Auto-healer : Finally ! Now the game heals itself, and you can enjoy the game at 100% as an idle game.
- Changed "Release" to "Manage Team" : For future updates

NGGYU.7 (03/14/17) :
- Finally a way to order Pokemon team. FOR THE MOMENT there's a button "First!" just click on it and the Pokemon will be on the top of the list. It does the job for the moment perfectly. Huge thanks to piiih for this feature !

NGGYU.6 (03/12/17) :
- Another huge clean in the original code (database related)
- Fixing types chart ! (For example Dragon hitting ONLY * .1 on Rock Pokemon)
- Preparing stuff for event days (Bonus of experience OR catch rate for the moment) stay tunned for that !
- Stats for the mega Pokemon of the 1G added ! You can check how to get them in the future, not available
- Finally a favicon
- All Pokemon are now available (I deleted some of them by mistake by redoing the routes)
- **HUGE GAMEPLAY CHANGE** : Before, the game didn't take in consideration Special Stats. This way, Chansey was really under-powered or Pokemon like Mewtwo would be less effective. Before, Pokemon were using only Attack + Defense. Now it's the average of both Physical and Special stats. This should change a lot of things. Keep me updated for any bug or anything.

NGGYU.5 (03/05/17) : 
- Fixed Eeveelutions by being available in the wild
- Fixed some Fairy glitched Pokemon
- Fixed https links with the help of the PR
- Fixed the level 101 glitch (level 100 is the max level, it'll be adjusted if you had a level 101 Pokemon)
- Better catch rate (need feedback for this)
- Updated the CSS in order to have the same looks as before (bad edit before in order to have all areas in the same place)
- **HUGE** update of the database. Deleted 70k of lines for stuff NOT used in game. Edited in order to add new gens without any difficulty. So this will be a thing soon.

NGGYU.4 (03/02/17) :
- Updated the catch rates. 90% of them were missing. Should change the gameplay A LOT.

NGGYU.3 (03/01/17) :
- Areas redone completly. Removed customs areas for matching the real routes from Kanto. CSS need to be updated.

NGGYU.2 (02/28/17) :
- Fixed all the evolutions levels.

NGGYU.1 (02/28/17) :
- Initial Version
