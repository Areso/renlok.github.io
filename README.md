Original idea from MarcoWorms. Just used a fork in order to make something more fresh and updated.

WIP.

Planned :

- Adding Shiny (+ Auto-capture if Shiny)
- Re-doing Areas
- Ordering Team
- Evos back to classic levels.
- Later : Other gens.

My coding skills are really really (when I say really it's really) limited. So any help would be more than apprecied. Just trying to bring some ideas and doing the boring stuff.
